	<p><b>CLIPPER&reg; CARDHOLDER LICENSE AGREEMENT - TERMS AND CONDITIONS</b><a name="#terms" href="downloads/Clipper_License_Agreement_English.pdf" target="_blank">(PDF)</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a name="#terms" href="downloads/Clipper_License_Agreement_English.doc"  target="_blank">(Text version) </a> </p> 

<p><b>YOUR FIRST USE OF THE CLIPPER&reg; SMART CARD SIGNIFIES YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THIS CLIPPER&reg; CARDHOLDER LICENSE AGREEMENT.</b></p> 

<p><b>1.&nbsp;	DEFINITIONS</b>

<br/><b>1.1</b>&nbsp;	The Card - is the Clipper&reg; Card licensed to Cardholders to pay transit fares on participating transit systems. The Card is the property of MTC, the Card Issuer. Each Card is uniquely identified by a serial number printed on the back of the Card.

<br/><b>1.2</b>&nbsp;	MTC - is the Metropolitan Transportation Commission. 

<br/><b>1.3</b>&nbsp;	Cardholder - is the bearer of a Card. 

<br/><b>1.4</b>&nbsp;	Service Providers - are transit agencies participating in the Clipper&reg; Fare Payment System (FPS). Current information on Service Providers is available at clippercard.com. 

<br/><b>1.5</b>&nbsp;	Clipper&reg; Customer Service Center - is an agent of MTC.

<br/><b>1.6</b>&nbsp;	Registered Card - is a Card for which the Cardholder has provided a valid name, address, phone number and email address (if available) to the Clipper&reg; Customer Service Center for the creation of a record in the Clipper&reg; customer database. 

<br/><b>1.7</b>&nbsp; Use - includes registering a Card, adding cash value or a transit pass to a Card, or using a Card to pay for transit service or parking.</p>



<p><b>2.&nbsp;	CARD TYPES</b>

<br/><b>2.1</b>&nbsp;	Four types of Clipper&reg; cards are available:

<br/><b>2.1.1</b>&nbsp;	Adult Cards - are available for use on all Service Providers.

<br/><b>2.1.2</b>&nbsp;	Youth Cards - are available for Cardholders eligible for youth discounts offered by Service Providers. Date of birth information will be encoded onto the Card.

<br/><b>2.1.3</b>&nbsp;	Senior Cards - are available for Cardholders eligible for senior discounts offered by Service Providers. Date of birth information will be encoded onto the Card.

<br/><b>2.1.4</b>&nbsp;	Senior/Disabled Cards - are distributed in accordance with the Regional Transit Connection (RTC) Discount Card Program, which is managed by the Service Providers.</p>



<p><b>3.&nbsp;	FARE PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS</b>

<br/><b>3.1</b>&nbsp;	Each Service Provider determines the fares and other conditions for use of the Clipper&reg; Card on its transit system. 

<br/><b>3.2</b>&nbsp;	For cash transactions, the value of each ride is deducted from the Cardholder's cash balance when he/she uses his/her Card.

<br/><b>3.3</b>&nbsp;	All fares, including promotional or discount fares, are subject to change, review, and withdrawal by the relevant Service Provider at any time. 

<br/><b>3.3.1</b>&nbsp;	If the Cardholder is eligible for a discount based on age, date of birth information needs to be encoded onto the Card. The Cardholder's age, as calculated from date of birth, and the Service Provider's existing policy for cash discounts based on age shall determine whether a discount cash fare is deducted at the point of use. 

<br/><b>3.4</b>&nbsp;	If a ride costs more than the cash value on the Cardholder's Clipper&reg; card, Clipper&reg; may let the Cardholder complete the trip even if the fare exceeds the Card's remaining value.However, sufficient value must be added to the Card to pay for the prior trip before the Card can be used again. 

<br/><b>3.5</b>&nbsp;	If, for any reason, the Card is not accepted for fare payment on a participating Service Provider, the Cardholder may be required by the Service Provider to pay the fare in cash.</p>



<p><b>4.&nbsp;	ADD VALUE TRANSACTIONS</b>

<br/>MTC may require a minimum add value amount when the Cardholder acquires the Card. The maximum amount of cash value that can be stored on any Card is $300 If a Cardholder tries to load cash that causes the Card balance to exceed $300,  the entire transaction will not be processed. The Cardholder is responsible for  knowing his/her balance.</p>



<p><b>5. &nbsp;	CARD LOSS AND DAMAGE</b>

<br/><b>5.1</b>&nbsp;	The Cardholder shall not alter or interfere with the graphic or data of the Card and shall take all reasonable measures and care to ensure that the graphic and Card Data are not interfered or tampered with. Cards that have had holes punched in them will be considered damaged and not defective.

<br/><b>5.2</b>&nbsp;	Balance Restoration for Lost, Stolen and Damaged Clipper&reg; Cards: 

<br/><b>5.2.1</b>&nbsp;	Only a Registered Card is eligible for card balance protection in the event that a Card is lost, stolen or damaged. A Cardholder may apply to MTC for the cancellation of a lost, stolen or damaged Card and the issuance of a new Card or a refund subject to the payment of any fees, as described in Section 10. 

<br/><b>5.2.2</b>	&nbsp;The Cardholder is responsible for any payments made with the Card up until the end of the day on which the Cardholder reports the Card lost, stolen or damaged to the Clipper&reg; Customer Service Center.

<br/><b>5.2.3</b>&nbsp;	When issuing a replacement or refund for a lost, stolen or damaged Card, the Clipper&reg; Customer Service Center will restore the full value of a Registered Card's balance as of the end of the day that the Card was reported lost, stolen or damaged. If the Cardholder requests a replacement for a damaged Card at an authorized in-person location, the Clipper&reg; Customer Service Center will restore the full value of the balance at the time the damaged Card is surrendered for replacement. Period passes (passes valid for a specified time limit) and stored ride products (multiple-ride discounts) that are restored will have the same expiration date as the fare products that were on the original Card.

<br/><b>5.2.4</b>&nbsp;	A Cardholder with a lost, stolen, damaged or defective Senior/Disabled (RTC Discount) Card may apply for its cancellation and the issuance of a new Senior/Disabled (RTC Discount) Card in accordance with the policies of the RTC Discount Card Program.

<br/><b>5.3</b>&nbsp;	Defective Clipper&reg; Cards<br/>

 The Cardholder holds the Card at his/her own risk. If the Card malfunctions due to no fault of the Cardholder, he/she may return the Card to the Clipper&reg; Customer Service Center, and MTC shall refund any remaining cash value (except as provided in Section 7.3) or transfer any remaining Card value to a new Card if the Card is returned within one year from the date that the Cardholder first used the Card. If the Clipper&reg; Customer Service Center determines that the card is not defective but has been damaged, the Cardholder may request a replacement card in accordance with Section 5.2.<p>



 <p><b>6.&nbsp;	OPTIONAL FEATURES</b>

<br/><b>6.1&nbsp;	Clipper&reg; Card Registration: </b>    

<br/><b>6.1.1</b>	&nbsp;The Cardholder can register his/her Adult Clipper&reg; Card with the Clipper&reg; Customer Service Center by providing a valid name, address, phone number and email address (if available).

<br/><b>6.1.2</b>	&nbsp;All Youth and Senior Clipper&reg; cards, as well as Senior/Disabled cards issued in accordance with the Regional Transit Connection (RTC) Discount Card Program, are automatically registered.

<br/><b>6.1.3</b>	&nbsp;A Youth, Senior or Senior/Disabled card that has been registered to an individual 

is not transferable and can be used only by the person identified in the Clipper&reg; customer database.

<br/><b>6.1.4</b>	&nbsp;A Card must be registered in order for the Cardholder to receive a copy 

of the transaction history record from the Clipper&reg; Customer Service Center.

<br/><b>6.1.5</b>	&nbsp;The Clipper&reg; Customer Service Center may use the contact information associated with Registered Cards to communicate with cardholders about issues related to the Registered Card or the operation of the system per MTC's Clipper&reg; Privacy Policy, as referenced in Section 13.

<br/><b>6.1.6</b>	&nbsp;MTC reserves the right to decline a request to register a Card or to refuse Registered Card services (refunds, card replacement, etc.) in order to prevent fraudulent use or abuse of Registered Card features and benefits. 

<br/><b>6.2&nbsp;	Autoload </b>    

<br/><b>6.2.1</b>	&nbsp;By setting up Autoload, the Cardholder authorizes MTC to automatically reload value to his/her Card by means of a bank or credit card account whenever one of the following occurs: (1) the Cardholder's cash or BART High Value Discount balance falls below $10; (2) the Cardholder's transit pass expires (e.g., the first of every month); or (3) the number of stored rides remaining on the Cardholder's Card falls below three. 

<br/><b>6.2.2</b>&nbsp;	The Cardholder may request to terminate Autoload at any time by mailing or faxing a written request to the Clipper&reg; Customer Service Center, or by editing the Autoload set-up via the Clipper&reg; website at clippercard.com. In order to complete the Autoload termination process, the Cardholder must tag the Card on a Clipper&reg; card reader after the Clipper&reg; Customer Service Center processes the request. If the Card balance reaches an Autoload threshold identified in Section 6.2.1 before the Autoload termination process is completed, the Card will continue to Autoload the pre-specified value and the Cardholder will be liable for payment.

<br/><b>6.2.3</b>&nbsp;	If Autoload payment for cash value is declined for any reason, the Clipper&reg; Customer Service Center will block the Card. If Autoload payment for BART High Value Discount, a transit pass or stored rides is declined for any reason, the Clipper&reg; Customer Service Center will block that specific transit product from further use. In order to have the value unblocked, the Cardholder must provide a valid payment method on the Clipper&reg; website at clippercard.com or by submitting a signed form to the Clipper&reg; Customer Service Center. The Clipper&reg; Customer Service Center will issue an action to unblock 

the card or product after collecting funds for the Autoload value. 

<br/><b>6.2.4</b>&nbsp;	MTC reserves the right to decline a request to set up a Card for Autoload or to accept an alternative payment (bank or credit card) source in order to prevent fraudulent use or abuse of Autoload features and benefits.</p>
