<br/><b>1.7</b>&nbsp; Use - includes registering a Card, adding cash value or a transit pass to a Card, or using a Card to pay for transit service or parking.</p>



<p><b>2.&nbsp;	CARD TYPES</b>

<br/><b>2.1</b>&nbsp;	Four types of Clipper&reg; cards are available:

<br/><b>2.1.1</b>&nbsp;	Adult Cards - are available for use on all Service Providers.

<br/><b>2.1.2</b>&nbsp;	Youth Cards - are available for Cardholders eligible for youth discounts offered by Service Providers. Date of birth information will be encoded onto the Card.

<p><b>3.&nbsp;	FARE PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS</b>

<br/><b>3.1</b>&nbsp;	Each Service Provider determines the fares and other conditions for use of the Clipper&reg; Card on its transit system. 

<br/><b>3.2</b>&nbsp;	For cash transactions, the value of each ride is deducted from the Cardholder's cash balance when he/she uses his/her Card.

<br/><b>3.3</b>&nbsp;	All fares, including promotional or discount fares, are subject to change, review, and withdrawal by the relevant Service Provider at any time. 

<br/><b>3.3.1</b>&nbsp;	If the Cardholder is eligible for a discount based on age, date of birth information needs to be encoded onto the Card. The Cardholder's age, as calculated from date of birth, and the Service Provider's existing policy for cash discounts based on age shall determine whether a discount cash fare is deducted at the point of use. 

<br/><b>3.4</b>&nbsp;	If a ride costs more than the cash value on the Cardholder's Clipper&reg; card, Clipper&reg; may let the Cardholder complete the trip even if the fare exceeds the Card's remaining value.However, sufficient value must be added to the Card to pay for the prior trip before the Card can be used again. 

<br/><b>3.5</b>&nbsp;	If, for any reason, the Card is not accepted for fare payment on a participating Service Provider, the Cardholder may be required by the Service Provider to pay the fare in cash.</p>



<p><b>4.&nbsp;	ADD VALUE TRANSACTIONS</b>

<br/>MTC may require a minimum add value amount when the Cardholder acquires the Card. The maximum amount of cash value that can be stored on any Card is $300 If a Cardholder tries to load cash that causes the Card balance to exceed $300,  the entire transaction will not be processed. The Cardholder is responsible for  knowing his/her balance.</p>



<p><b>5. &nbsp;	CARD LOSS AND DAMAGE</b>

<br/><b>5.1</b>&nbsp;	The Cardholder shall not alter or interfere with the graphic or data of the Card and shall take all reasonable measures and care to ensure that the graphic and Card Data are not interfered or tampered with.
