<h3 id="using">Questions About Using Clipper</h3>
<h4 class="first"> Is there a cost to get a Clipper card?</h4>
<p>A new Adult Clipper card costs $3. Clipper will waive this fee if you purchase your card online and sign up for Autoload at the same time. If you purchase a card at a Muni Metro or Golden Gate Ferry ticket machine, you will need to load a minimum amount of value to your new card. At other locations and on clippercard.com, no minimum value is required for new cards.</p>
<p>Youth and Senior Clipper cards are free. RTC Clipper cards are priced in accordance with RTC program policies. Visit <a href="discounts/index.do">Clipper discounts</a> for more information.</p>
<h4>Is it safe to purchase Clipper cards posted on Craigslist and similar sites?</h4>
<p>Clipper cards purchased on Craigslist and similar sites may appear legitimate and even work initially, but can be blocked if the card you purchased is the subject of a scam.</p>
<p>Avoid scams by purchasing Clipper cards and products ONLY from authorized vendors such as clippercard.com, transit agency ticket offices, transit ticket machines, Walgreens and other participating retailers (full list <a href="map.do">here</a>).</p>
<h4>When I pay a fare using Clipper, how do I know if the proper fare value has been deducted from my card?</h4>
<p>When you use your Clipper card with either a transit pass or cash value, a single or double beep will indicate the correct fare has been deducted or that a valid pass or transfer has been found. Each time you pay your fare with cash, the card reader displays the fare deducted and shows how much you have left.</p>
<p>When you load cash value combined with a transit pass on your card, the card reader will always charge you the lowest fare possible. The Clipper system always checks first to see if your card has a valid pass or transfer before deducting cash.</p>
<h4>How do I know Clipper is charging me the right fare?</h4>
<p>When you use your Clipper card with either a transit pass or cash value, a single or double beep will indicate the correct fare has been deducted or that a valid pass or transfer has been found. Each time you pay your fare with cash, the card reader displays the fare deducted and shows how much you have left. On BART, you will see the balance on your card when you tag on and enter the system and then the amount deducted and remaining balance when you complete your trip and tag off. On Caltrain, SF Bay Ferry, Golden Gate Transit buses and Sonoma County Transit, you will see the maximum fare when you tag on, but will see the amount refunded to you at the end of your trip when you tag off.</p>
<p>Clipper always checks first to see if your card has a valid pass or transfer before deducting cash value, ensuring you are always charged the lowest possible fare.</p>
<h4>Can I punch a hole in my Clipper card, so I can wear it around my neck or clip it to a belt or purse?</h4>
<p>Do not alter your Clipper card in any way. Punching holes in the card, bending it or otherwise altering it could damage the small antenna used to send information between the card and the card reader. If the antenna is damaged, the card will not function properly.</p>
<h4>Can I punch a hole in my Clipper card, so I can wear it around my neck or clip it to a belt or purse?</h4>
<p>The Clipper card should not be altered in any way. Punching holes in the card, bending it or otherwise altering it could damage the small antenna used to send information between the card and the card reader. If the antenna is damaged, the card will not function properly.</p>
<h4>Can two people use the same card at the same time?</h4>
<p>No, if two or more people are traveling together and want to use Clipper, each needs to have his or her own card.</p>
<h4>Can I get a refund for the value on my card?</h4>
<p>Refunds are only available to registered cardholders and are limited to cash value and unused passes and tickets. We cannot give refunds for partially used passes or tickets. Additionally, federal tax law prohibits refunds if a card has received any value through a pre-tax employee transit benefit program; customers cannot get a refund for any of the funds on the card - even if there was value on the card before joining the benefit program or if personal funds have been added separate from transit benefits.</p>
<p>Clipper charges a $5 administrative fee for processing a refund request; if your card does not have at least $5 in value on it, we cannot process your refund request.</p>
<p>To get a refund, complete the <a href="/downloads/clipper_cancellationform_120213.pdf">Clipper Cancellation Form</a> and send it to Clipper Customer Service along with your payment information. Your refund request will typically be processed within 30 days.</p>

<h3 id="managing">Questions About Managing Your Clipper Account</h3>
<h4 class="first"> Can a Clipper account have more than one card associated with it?</h4>
<p>You can have multiple adult cards associated with a single account. If you log into your account and order a card, Clipper will automatically register your new card to your existing account. If you get another card in person, log in to your account, and click on "Register a card" to associate the new card with your account. </p>
<p>Youth, Senior and RTC Clipper cards must have their own accounts</p>
<h4>My spouse, relative, or close friend needs help managing their registered Clipper card. How can I manage the account on their behalf?</h4>
<p>The Clipper program, as a matter of law and policy, does not disclose Clipper account information to someone who is not the registered cardholder, unless Clipper has the cardholder's authorization to do so. Registered cardholders can complete and sign a form authorizing another individual to act on behalf of the cardholder. To request a form and find out more information about the authorization requirements, please contact Clipper Customer Service at 877.878.8883 (TDD/TTY 711 or 800.735.2929).</p>

<h3 id="value">Questions About Types of Value and How to Add Value</h3>
<h4 class="first"> How can I add value to my Clipper card?</h4>
<p>You can add value in several ways. Value added in person is available instantly, while it may take up to 5 days for value added online or over the phone to be available.</p>
<ul class="bulletList">
<li><a href="../ClipperCard/manage.jsf"><b>Online</b></a> at clippercard.com. If you place your order by 6 p.m., you can usually pick up your value in the next 1 to 2 days. If you will pick up your value on a bus or a Muni light-rail vehicle, please allow up to 5 days.</li>
<li><b>Automatically</b> - by setting up <a href="getTranslinkRegisterForAutoloadInfo.do">Autoload</a> at clippercard.com. Value is available immediately after a one-time credit or bank-card authorization process.</li>
<li><b>Over the phone</b> - by calling 877.878.8883. If you place your order by 6 p.m., you can usually pick up your value in the next 1 to 2 days. If you will pick up your value on a bus or a Muni light-rail vehicle, please allow up to 5 days.</li>
<li><b>In person</b> - at participating retailers, transit agency ticket machines and ticket offices, Clipper Customer Service Centers, and Clipper Add Value machines (click <a href="map.do">here</a> for locations). Value is available immediately.</li>
<li><b>At work</b> - through your employee transit benefit program. If ordered online, value is available by the first day of the benefit month.</li>
</ul>
<h4>When can I use the value I purchased?</h4>
<p>If you add value to your card at a retailer, Clipper Customer Service Center, ticket office, ticket machine or Clipper Add Value Machine, your value is immediately available to use.</p>
<p>When you add value to your Clipper card either online or over the phone, your value will not be available immediately. Once the value is available, you must tag your card to a card reader in order to load the value. Your card balance will not be updated until you have tagged your card and loaded the value. </p>
<ul class="bulletList">
	<li>If you place your order by 6 p.m., you can usually pick up your value in the next 1 to 2 days.</li>
	<li>If you are picking up your value on a bus or a Muni light-rail vehicle, please allow up to 5 days.</li>
	<li>If you are setting up Autoload with a bank account, please allow an additional 10 days for value to first be available.</li>
</ul>
<h4>How long do I have to pick up the value that I ordered online or by phone?</h4>
<p>When you order a monthly pass, the pass is for a specific calendar month and must be loaded to your card before the pass expiration date. When you set up Autoload or add value to your Clipper card either online or over the phone, you have six months from the order date to tag your card to a card reader to load cash value, discount tickets, 31-day passes and parking value. If you do not tag your card within six months, call Clipper Customer Service at 877.878.8883 (TDD/TTY 711 or 800.735.2929) for assistance.</p>
<h4>Can I use the cash loaded on my Clipper card to purchase a transit pass for my card?</h4>
<p>Cash and transit passes are treated as separate products by the Clipper card. Once a product is loaded onto the card, it cannot be converted or exchanged for another product. For example, you cannot convert an existing transit pass into an equivalent amount of cash value, nor can you exchange your cash value for a transit pass.</p>
<p>[<a href="#pageHeader">back to top</a>]</p>
<h3 id="autoload">Questions about Autoload</h3>
<h4 class="first"> How does Autoload work with my Clipper card?</h4>
<p>If you set up Autoload, Clipper will automatically add value to your card whenever your balance falls below $10 for transit and below $40 for parking, your transit pass expires, or you have only two rides remaining on a multi-ride transit ticket.</p>
<h4>Do I have to add value to set up my Autoload?</h4>
<p>When you set up Autoload for a transit pass or multi-ride ticket, you will have to purchase a new pass or multi-ride ticket at that time. The Caltrain system also requires you to have a cash value balance of $1.25 to activate Autoload for a Monthly Pass or 8-ride Ticket. You do not need to add value to set up Autoload for cash value, BART High Value Discount tickets or parking value.</p>
<h4>When will I be charged for my Autoload value?</h4>
<p>If you are setting up Autoload for cash value, parking value or BART High Value Discount tickets, Clipper won't charge your credit card or bank account until you tag your Clipper card to a card reader and load the value.</p>
<p>If you are setting up Autoload for a transit pass for the first time, Clipper will charge your credit card or bank account <u>before</u> making the pass available for you to pick up. After that, Clipper will not charge you until <u>after</u> you tag your card and load your pass on it.</p>
<h4>I set up Autoload, but it's not showing up in my online account. Why not?</h4>
<p>When you first set up Autoload, the process is not complete until (1) we confirm you have provided a valid payment source and then (2) you tag your card to a card reader or fare gate and activate Autoload. Once you do that, your Autoload set-up will appear in your account.</p>
<ul class="bulletList">
	<li>If you place your order by 6 p.m., you can usually pick up your value in the next 1 to 2 days.</li>
	<li>If you are picking up your value on a bus or a Muni light-rail vehicle, please allow up to 5 days.</li>
	<li>If you are setting up Autoload with a bank account, please allow an additional 10 days for value to first be available.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you set up Autoload, you have six months from the order date to tag your card to activate your Autoload. If you do not have an opportunity to tag your card within six months, please call Clipper Customer Service at 877.878.8883 (TDD/TTY 711 or 800.735.2929) for assistance.</p>
<h4>How do I edit the payment information I used to set up my Autoload?</h4>
<p>Log in to your online Clipper account, click on the <em>Payment Information</em> link in the left-hand navigation bar, provide your payment information details and click "Save".</p>
<p>When you update the payment information details, the new credit card or bank account will be used for every card associated with your account that is set up for Autoload. You cannot use different payment methods for each of your cards with Autoload.</p>
<p>If you haven't done so already, you may want to add a backup credit card for your Autoload purchases. If your primary Autoload funding source is declined, your order will be charged to your backup card. Log in to clippercard.com and select Payment Information to add a backup credit card.</p>
<h4>What happens if my Autoload payment fails?</h4>
<p>If the credit/debit card or bank account you use for Autoload is declined, here is what will happen:</p>
<ol>
	<li>We will automatically send an email with the subject âDeclined Clipper Autoload Paymentâ to the email address in your Clipper account.</li>
	<li>If you want to continue using the value on your Clipper card without interruption, we must collect payment <strong>before 6 p.m. on the day we send you the declined payment notice</strong>. If we do not collect payment before this deadline, we may block your pass/ticket or, in the case of cash value, your entire Clipper card. Your card value will remain blocked until we can collect payment from a valid credit card or bank account.<br /><br />You must log into clippercard.com, select <em>Payment Information</em>, and provide a valid credit card. We will automatically send you an email with the subject "Confirmation of Clipper Account Modification" to indicate that you have updated information in your account. This is separate from confirmation of payment.</li>
	<li>Once we have successfully charged your credit card, we will send you an email with the subject "Autoload Payment/Card Status Update". If you choose instead to provide bank account information, it may take up to 10 business days for Clipper to collect payment.</li>
	<li>If we block your card value, allow at least one day for your card to be unblocked, and then you will need to tag your card to a card reader or ticket machine to activate the unblock. This process may take up to five days if you are tagging only on a bus or light-rail vehicle. Shorten the time it takes to unblock your Clipper card to as little as one day by tagging a:
		<ul class="bulletList">
			<li>fare gate;</li>
			<li>card reader at a train station or ferry terminal; </li>
			<li>Golden Gate Ferry, Muni or VTA ticket machine; or</li>
			<li>Clipper Add Value Machine.</li>
		</ul>
		You can also have staff at a transit agency ticket office or Clipper Customer Service Center tag your card to update its status.</li>
	</ol>
<p>To avoid this problem in the future, you may want to add a backup credit card for your Autoload purchases. If your primary Autoload funding source is declined, your order will be charged to your backup card. Log in to clippercard.com and select Payment Information to add a backup credit card.</p>
<h4>My card/value was blocked due to an expired credit card. Why wasn't I given advance notice that this would happen?</h4>
<p>We do notify customers that their credit cards are due to expire 30 and 60 days before the expiration date. If you did not receive these notices and your card was blocked due to an expired credit card, it may be that we do not have the correct email address for you, or that our email was blocked by a spam filter.</p>
<p>To update your email address, log into clippercard.com with the email address we have on file, select <em>Profile Information</em>, and provide an updated email address. Note that you will need to use this new email address the next time you log in to your Clipper account.</p>
<p>To ensure our emails are not blocked by your spam filter, please add <a href="mailto:custserv@clippercard.com">custserv@clippercard.com</a> to your list of approved email addresses.</p>
<p>To avoid your card being blocked in the future, you may want to add a backup credit card for your Autoload purchases. If your primary Autoload funding source is declined, your order will be charged to your backup card. Log in to clippercard.com and select <em>Payment Information</em> to add a backup credit card.</p>
<h4>What if my card doesn't work, and the card reader says "BLOCKED BAD DEBT"?</h4>
<p>If the card reader says "BLOCKED BAD DEBT", it means Clipper could not process your Autoload payment, and we have blocked your pass/ticket or, in the case of cash value, your entire Clipper card. To unblock your card:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Log into clippercard.com, select <em>Payment Information</em>, and provide a valid credit card. We will automatically send you an email with the subject "Confirmation of Clipper Account Modification" to indicate that you have updated information in your account. This is separate from confirmation of payment.</li>
	<li>Once we have successfully charged your credit card, we will send you an email with the subject "Autoload Payment/Card Status Update". If you choose instead to provide bank account information, it may take up to 10 business days for Clipper to collect payment.</li>
	<li>Once you receive the email confirming successful payment, allow at least one day for your card to be unblocked. You will need to tag your card to a card reader or ticket machine to activate the unblock. This process may take up to five days if you are tagging only on a bus or light-rail vehicle. Shorten the time it takes to unblock your Clipper to as little as one day by tagging a:
	<ul class="bulletList">
		<li>fare gate;</li>
		<li>card reader at a train station or ferry terminal; </li>
		<li>Golden Gate Ferry, Muni or VTA ticket machine; or</li>
		<li>Clipper Add Value Machine.</li>
	</ul>
	You can also have staff at a transit agency ticket office or Clipper Customer Service Center tag your card to update its status.
	</li>
</ol>
<p>Prior to your card being blocked, you should have received an email with the subject "Declined Clipper Autoload Payment". If you did not receive this email, it may be that we do not have the correct email address for you, or that our email was blocked by a spam filter. To update your email address, log into clippercard.com with the email address we have on file, select <em>Profile Information</em>, and provide an updated email address. Note that you will need to use this new email address the next time you log in to your Clipper account. To ensure our emails are not blocked by your spam filter, please add <a href="mailto:custserv@clippercard.com">custserv@clippercard.com</a> to your list of approved email addresses.</p>
<p>Also, if you haven't done so already, you may want to add a backup credit card for your Autoload purchases. If your primary Autoload funding source is declined, your order will be charged to your backup card. Log in to clippercard.com and select <em>Payment Information</em> to add a backup credit card.</p>
<h4>How do I cancel Autoload?</h4>
<p>Log in to your online Clipper account and scroll to the card for which you want to cancel Autoload. Click on "Disable Autoload". When a confirmation box pops up, click "Yes". </p>
<p>The process is completed when you "deactivate" Autoload by tagging your card to a card reader or fare gate. Clipper will continue to Autoload your card according to your account settings until you complete the cancellation process.</p>
<ul class="bulletList">
	<li>If you cancel Autoload by 6 p.m., you can usually tag to deactivate Autoload in the next 1 to 2 days.</li>
	<li>If you normally ride a bus or a Muni light-rail vehicle, please allow up to 5 days.</li>
</ul>
<p>You must tag your card to complete the deactivation process within six months of submitting your request, or you will need to resubmit your cancellation request.</p>
<p>To check on the status of your cancellation order, please call Clipper Customer Service at 877.878.8883 (TDD/TTY 711 or 800.735.2929).</p>

<h3 id="programs">Questions About Employee Transit Benefit Programs</h3>
<h4 class="first">Does Clipper work with pre-tax transit benefit programs?</h4>
<p>Clipper works with Commuter Check&reg;, WageWorks&reg; and other transit benefit providers. <a href="transitbenefits.do">Learn more about employee transit benefit programs.</a></p>
<h4>My transit benefit program told me they sent you the money. Why isn't it on my Clipper card?</h4>
<p>Your value normally will be available by the first day of the benefit month. You must tag your card to a card reader to pick up the value and update your card balance. If you do not receive your transit benefit value by the first day of the benefit month, please contact Clipper Customer Service at 877.878.8883 (TDD/TTY 711 or 800.735.2929).</p>
<h4>Why is there a fee to load transit benefits to my Clipper card every month?</h4>
<p>Clipper charges third-party transit benefit administrators (like WageWorks and Commuter Check) a monthly per-account fee to process and load transit benefits orders directly to their customers' Clipper cards. Some third-party administrators may pass along this monthly processing fee to their clients (employers), and some of those employers may choose to pass the fee along to their employees. The fee will only be charged if you choose to have your order loaded directly to your Clipper card and you accept the fee when you place your transit benefits order.</p>
<p>You may be able to avoid the fee and receive your transit benefits via vouchers or a commuter debit card instead. Check with your employer or transit benefit provider to find out what options are available where you work.</p>
<h4>Can I use my transit benefit debit card to set up Autoload for my Clipper card?</h4>
<p>You can use your transit benefit debit card to set up Autoload on your Clipper card, but you should also set up a regular credit card as a backup payment card in your account. That way, if your Clipper card needs reloading at a time when funds are not available on your transit benefit card, Clipper will charge the entire order to your backup card, ensuring you receive your order and your Clipper card is not blocked due to insufficient funds on your transit benefit card.</p>
<h4>What happens if my benefit order will exceed the $300 cash balance limit?</h4>
<p>If your next order will cause your Clipper card to exceed the $300 maximum balance, Clipper cannot load the funds to your card. You have up to 6 months to spend down your balance, so you can load the funds. If you haven't reduced your balance by that time, the order will expire, and Clipper will return the value to your transit benefit provider.</p>
<h4>What happens if I get a new Clipper card after submitting my transit benefit order?</h4>
<p>If you get a new Clipper card, you must update the Clipper card serial number in your account with your transit benefit provider when you place your next order. If you get a new or replacement card after the deadline for modifying your transit benefit order, please contact Clipper Customer Service at 877.878.8883 (TDD/TTY 711 or 800.735.2929).</p>
<h4>What happens if I don't tag my Clipper card to load my transit benefit value to my card?</h4>
<p>Your transit benefit order should be available by the first of the benefit month. After it becomes available, you have up to 6 months to tag a card reader and load your benefit value to your card. However, if you tag and load a calendar-month pass after the validity period has expired, you will not be able to use the pass and you will not be eligible for a refund. If you do not tag your card at all during the 6-month period and would like a refund of your benefit order, contact your transit benefit provider for assistance.</p>
<h4>How do I get a refund for transit benefit value that is not added to my card as intended?</h4>
<p>You should contact your transit benefit provider for assistance.</p>
<h4>What happens if I decide to cancel my Clipper card? Who gets the refund of the transit benefit value?</h4>
<p>If you have ever loaded value to your Clipper card through a transit benefit provider, the entire value is ineligible for refunds, even if you had value on the card before joining the benefit program or if you have added your own funds separate from your transit benefits.</p>
<h4>My employer reimburses me for transit expenses. How can I get a record of what I have spent?</h4>
<p>Registered Clipper customers can request a card transaction history. Card transaction histories are available in PDF. Simply log in to your account and request a 30- or 60-day report for any card listed on your account. You also can contact Clipper Customer Service at 877.878.8883 (TDD/TTY 711 or 800.735.2929).</p>
<h4>Can my employer open an account with Clipper to provide transit benefits?</h4>
<p>Clipper Direct is a transit benefit program offered exclusively by Clipper. Clipper Direct makes it easy for employees to manage their transit benefits conveniently online. Visit <a href="http://clipperdirectbenefits.com" target="_blank">clipperdirectbenefits.com</a> for more information.</p>

<h3 id="problems">Questions About Card Problems</h3>
<h4 class="first"> What should I do if my card is lost or stolen?</h4>
<p>If your card is registered with the Clipper Customer Service Center, your balance is secure. You can report your card lost or stolen by:<p>
<ul class="bulletList">
<li> Logging in to your online Clipper account and clicking on "Report Lost, Stolen or Damaged Card"</li>
<li> Calling 877.878.8883 (TDD/TTY 711 or 800.735.2929) </li>
</ul>
 <p>We will block your card from further use and mail you a new card with your balance restored. Replacement cards are typically ready to be shipped within 2 business days of the card being reported lost or stolen.<p>
<p>If you would like to replace your card more quickly, first call the Clipper Customer Service number to report your card lost/stolen. Then visit a Clipper Customer Service Center location the next business day to pick up a replacement card. <a href="damagedCard.do">Visit Customer Support</a> for information about locations and hours.<p>
<p>There is a $5 fee for restoring balances.</p>
<h4>What happens if the card reader can't read my card?</h4>
<p>If you suspect your card to be defective, you will need to return your card to the Clipper Customer Service Center to be examined. If your card is found to be defective through no fault of your own and you have had it for less than a year, Clipper will replace the defective card and restore your balance free of charge. If your card is damaged, however, you are responsible for the fees associated with a replacement card and restoration of your balance.</p>
<p>The card reader may not have recognized your card for one of several reasons. Try tagging your card again by holding it flat against the Clipper logo on the card reader until you hear it beep. If your card is stored in your wallet or near chip-based cards that use radio frequency information, please remove it and tag it separately to the card reader. If you do not hear any beeps or see any lights, your card may be defective or damaged. You can mail your card to our Customer Service Center along with a completed <a href="/downloads/clipper_defectivecardform_120213.pdf">Clipper Defective Card Form</a> for the card to be tested, or you can visit one of our walk-up Customer Service Centers. Find locations <a href="damagedCard.do">here</a>.</p>
<h4>What should I do if my card stops working?</h4>
<p>If your card stops working, it may be either damaged or defective. We also will block your card if it is reported lost/stolen or if we have problems collecting payment for the value on your card. Call Clipper Customer Service at 877.878.8883 (TTY/TDD 711 or 800.735.2929) for assistance.</p>
<p>If you suspect your card to be defective, you will need to return your card by mail with a completed <a href="/downloads/clipper_defectivecardform_120213.pdf">Clipper Defective Card Form</a> to the Clipper Customer Service Center to be examined.

If your card is damaged, however, you are responsible for the fees associated with a replacement card and restoration of your balance.</p>
<p>For immediate replacement of non-personalized cards, you may bring your damaged or defective Clipper card to a Clipper Customer Service Center. Visit <a href="damagedCard.do">Customer Support</a> for information about locations and hours. You must have your card with you when you request a replacement.</p>
<h4>I was charged the wrong fare â can I get reimbursed?</h4>
<p>Call Clipper Customer Service at 877.878.8883, TDD/TTY 711 or 800.735.2929, to request reimbursement of any cash fares you feel have been mistakenly charged to your card.</p>
<p>[<a href="#pageHeader">back to top</a>]</p>

<h3 id="discounts">Questions About Discounts</h3>
<h4 class="first"> Is there a discount when adding value to a Clipper card?</h4>
<p>Each transit agency offers its own discounted fares, passes, and/or tickets for adults, youth, seniors and passengers with disabilities. When you use cash value on a Youth, Senior or RTC Clipper card, Clipper automatically applies any available discounts for which you are eligible. <a href="useTranslink.do">Learn more about where you can use Clipper</a> and access discounted fare and transfer information for each participating agency. </p>
<h4>How can I get a Youth or Senior Clipper card?</h4>
<p>You can apply for a Youth or Senior Clipper card by mail, email or fax, or you can apply for a card in person. Visit <a href="../discount">clippercard.com/discount</a> for more information.</p>
<h4>How do youth and senior fare discounts work with Clipper?</h4>
<p>Clipper youth and senior cards are specially encoded, so the system automatically gives you the discounted fare if appropriate. Clipper also recognizes when your card is eligible for discounted passes offered by transit agencies; you can purchase them via the Clipper website, over the phone, at a ticket or Add Value machine or in person at a Clipper retailer or transit agency ticket office if you have an eligible Clipper youth or senior card.</p>
<h4>I have a youth card. What happens when I am no longer eligible for youth discounts?</h4>
<p>Youth discounts will no longer be granted when your age exceeds the age limit for youth discounts established by the transit agency being used. On the day you are no longer eligible for a youth discount according to the transit agency being used, adult fares will be required.</p>
<ul class="bulletList">
	<li>If the card has a youth pass or ticket, the pass will be cancelled the day you are no longer eligible for youth discounts. This will happen even if it is the beginning or middle of a pass or if you still have rides left on your ticket.</li>
	<li>If the card has cash, Clipper will automatically begin charging you the adult fare.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your card is set up for Autoload and your birthday is coming up, you should disable Autoload before Clipper loads the new pass or ticket to prevent a product from being loaded that you will not be able to fully use. If you would like to purchase adult passes or tickets online or with Autoload, you will need to get an adult card.</p>
<h4>Can I add my child's/parent's Clipper youth/senior card to my Clipper account?</h4>
<p>Each youth and senior card is automatically registered by the Clipper Customer Service Center and therefore will have its own account. You can manage that account online using the same credit card that you use for any other Clipper cards; however, you will have to use a separate login to access the account.</p>
<h4>I am eligible for a youth or senior card, but I do not have any of the accepted forms of proof of eligibility. How can I apply for a card?</h4>
<p>If you do not have one of the accepted documents, you can submit a request in writing to your local transit agency with additional information that you feel will demonstrate that you are eligible. For example, if your child's school is willing to write a letter testifying that your child is eligible, you can submit that with your appeal. Any documentation should contain the applicant's date of birth. Your transit agency will respond to your appeal within 60 days.</p>
<h4>I have been using an adult Clipper card but now have a youth/senior card. Can I transfer my cash balance from my adult card to my discount card?</h4>
<p>Please contact Clipper Customer Service at 877.878.8883 (TTY/TDD 711 or 800.735.2929) to request a balance transfer. Note we can only transfer cash value; monthly passes and discount tickets cannot be transferred.</p>
<h4>I got my Youth Clipper card from AC Transit, and it had my photo on it. Do I need to go to AC Transit to have another photo taken for a replacement card?</h4>
<p>No, AC Transit no longer requires youth to have a photo on their Clipper cards, so you do not have to go in person to have a photo taken. You can report your card lost or stolen and pay the $5 card replacement fee by logging into your Clipper account and clicking on "Report Lost, Stolen or Damaged Card" or by calling Clipper Customer Service at 877.878.8883 (TDD/TTY 711 or 800.735.2929). You will receive a replacement card without a photo in the mail.</p>
<p>If you would like to replace your card more quickly, first call the Clipper Customer Service number to report your card lost/stolen. Then visit a Clipper Customer Service Center location the next business day to pick up a replacement card.

<h3 id="ivr">Questions About Clipper's Automated Phone Service</h3>
<h4 class="first"> What can I do with Clipper's new Automated Phone Service?</h4>
<p>You can:</p>
<ul class="bulletList">
	<li>Get information about your pending orders</li>
	<li>Check current account balances on your passes, discount tickets and cash value</li>
	<li>Listen to your recent transaction history</li>
	<li>Add cash value to your card (if you have a credit card on file)</li>
</ul>
<h4>Is my account information safe on Clipper's automated phone service?</h4>
<p>Clipper's automated phone service was built with security in mind. Changes to your account require the use of a personal identification number (PIN), similar to what you might use at an ATM. This PIN is unique to you and ensures that others cannot access your account.</p>
<h4>How do I gain access to my card information on Clipper's automated phone service?</h4>
<p>First, you must <a href="/ClipperCard/register.jsf">register your card online</a>. If you have already registered your card, you only need to create a personal identification number (PIN) to use Clipper's automated phone service.</p>
<ul class="bulletList">
	<li>The first time you call Clipper's automated phone service, you will be asked to enter a personalized, four-digit PIN. Pick a number that is easy to remember, but not one that others may know or guess â don't choose 1111, 1234, your birth year or similar numbers.</li>
	<li>After you have chosen and entered your PIN, we will send you an email with a PIN activation link. Click on the link, and you will go to a page confirming that your PIN has been activated.</li>
	<li>Once your PIN has been activated, simply enter it to access your account whenever you call Clipper.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What happens if I forget my personal identification number (PIN)?</h4>
<p>When you call Clipper, you will have the option to enter a PIN or receive a new one. Follow the automated prompts to receive a new PIN, we will send your new PIN to your email account. Be sure to keep a record of your new PIN.</p>
<h4>When is Clipper's automated phone service available?</h4>
<p>Clipper's automated phone service is available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Some functions that require assistance from a customer service representative may not be available during non-business hours.</p>

<h3 id="privacy">Questions about Clipper's Privacy Policy</h3>
<h4 class="first"> How does Clipper protect my privacy?</h4>
<p>The Clipper Privacy Policy is the primary document through which the Clipper program communicates our commitment to protect a customer's personally identifiable information (PII).</p>
<p>Clipper's Privacy Policy explains the types of PII that are collected by the Clipper program and also how PII, as well as aggregate data and anonymous data derived from PII, may be used.</p>
<p>The policy states that MTC shares PII only with the following groups:</p>
<ul class="bulletList">
	<li>Participating transit agencies for the purpose of operating and managing Clipper;</li>
	<li>Persons or entities contracting with the Clipper program, solely for the purpose of operating and managing Clipper; and</li>
	<li>In order to comply with laws or legal processes served on MTC or Clipper Contractors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Customer PII may only be used by MTC to perform necessary account management activities. Customers who wish to use Clipper anonymously may do so by not registering their cards.</p>
<p>Anonymous data and aggregate data may be used by MTC for any MTC purpose, and MTC may make anonymous data and aggregate data available to third parties.</p>
<p>The full policy is available at: <a href="privacy.do">clippercard.com/privacy</a></p>
<h4>How long is Personally Identifiable Information (PII) retained by Clipper?</h4>
<p>The Clipper Privacy Policy specifies program data retention policies, but in general data is retained no longer than 4.5 years after a registered account is closed.</p>
<h4>The Privacy Policy states that information may be released to a third party as required to comply with laws or legal processes served on MTC or the CSC Contractor. How frequently does this occur?</h4>
<p>For the period from July 1, 2014 through December 31, 2014, Clipper received six subpoenas requesting information. Information was released in one case because the Clipper was served with a federal subpoena. Information was also released pursuant to three of the subpoenas because the signed written consent of the person whose records were being sought was obtained. In the other two instances, MTC was required to withhold the requested information due to the statutory requirements of California Streets &amp; Highways Code Section 31490, which became effective on January 1, 2014 with respect to electronic transit fare collection systems. Additionally, Clipper was also served with two search warrants during this period. Information was released in one case; in the other case no responsive records were found.</p>
<p>For the period from January 1, 2015 through June 30, 2015, Clipper received one request for information from law enforcement. MTC was required to withhold the requested information due to the statutory requirements of California Streets & Highways Code Section 31490, which became effective on January 1, 2014 with respect to electronic transit fare collection systems. Clipper was also served with one search warrant and one notice of good cause statement. Information was released in both cases.</p>
<p>This information will be updated and posted on an annual basis.</p>
